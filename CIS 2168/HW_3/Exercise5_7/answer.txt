Assuming that x and t are nodes in a linked list. 
1. `t.next = x.next;` sets the next node of `t` to the next node of `x`.
2. `x.next = t;` changes the next reference to the node of `t`.
While this runs it will continue to run with no end and constantly change the value of `t` to whatever `x.next` is.
