# HW 7, Part 1

#### Exercise 7.1

What are the steps that transform the array in the top picture to the max-heap array of the
bottom picture?

In order to transform the array into a max-heap. We most arrange the nodes in which the parent node is greater tahn or equal to it's children.

1. Compare Y with its children ( D) and swap with the largest child if necessary.

```
P  L  A  Y  G  R  O  U  N  D
         ↓
P  L  A  Y  G  R  O  U  N  D
```

2. Compare L with it's children (Y and G) and swap with the largest.

```
P  L  A  Y  G  R  N  U  O  D
   ↓
P  Y  A  L  G  R  O  U  N  D
```

3. Now we compare P with it's children (Y and A)
   and again swap with the largest.

```
P  L  A  Y  G  R  N  U  O  D
↓
Y  P  A  L  G  R  O  U  N  D
```

4. Again, swap L's children (G and U) fopr the largest.

```
P  L  A  Y  G  R  N  U  O  D
↓
Y  P  A  L  G  R  O  U  N  D
```

5. Compare A with it's children (Y and U) and swap with largest.

```
P  L  A  Y  U  G  N  R  O  D
    ↓
P  L  Y  A  U  G  N  R  O  D
```

6. Comapre L with its children (Y and A) and swap with largest.

```
P  L  Y  A  U  G  N  R  O  D
↓
P  Y  L  A  U  G  N  R  O  D
```

Now the array is a max-heap:

```
Y P R N G A O L D
```

#### 7.2

Arrange the letters MISCOUNTED into a heap.

- What is the result? Explain the steps.

We first need to construct a binary tree for the array "MISCOUNTED".

```
          M
        /   \
       I     S
      / \   / \
     C   O U   N
    / \
   T   E
  /
D
```

Staring from the last non-leaf node and moving up to the root, we'll heapify:

- The subtree rooted at index 4 (O).
- The subtree rooted at index 3(C).
- The subtree rooted at index 2(S).
- The subtree rooted at index 1(I).
- the entire tree rooted at index 0(M).

The tree should look like this:

```
          U
        /   \
       T     S
      / \   / \
     I   O M   N
    / \
   C   E
  /
D
```

Finally, we extract the elements level by level to form the heaP, in which case it was arranged into a max heap.

```
U T S I O M N C E D
```
